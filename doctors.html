     <center><h1>Doctors</h1></center>
     <p>Doctors play an important role and most importantly they are playing an important role during this period of time while treating and fighting with coronavirus patients. Most of the doctors have losted their lives while treating to other patients. Doctors are trying their best to heal other patients  . As we know that in Italy MANY doctors have losted their life. Many doctors are working day and night
     and so they are sleeping in the hospital and they aren't able to meet their families. As they are sacrificing so much..so we should respect their sacrifice and stay at home, not going into a crowed place.etc taking care of our health.
    Thank You for YOUR Sacrifice🙏🙏🙏</p>
