            <h4><p>COVID-19 stands for Coronavirus Disease 2019. Cases of <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Uugj-zxA5E">COVID-19</a></b> first emerged in late 2019, when a mysterious illness was reported in Wuhan, China. The cause of the disease was soon confirmed as a new kind of coronavirus, and the infection has since spread to many countries around the world and become a fast pandemic. Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus. 
             The disease causes <b>respiratory illness</b> (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). 
             Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</p>
